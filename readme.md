# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

    # a dog smiling more or less, with bigger or smaller eye shinies

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

    # a variable for number of sides to change the smile amount and a variable for the forward amount for the circle eye shinies 

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

    # multiple circles are drawn and shapes in general that will use the same base code

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

    # there's the dog head, the nose, the smile, the eyes, and the ears

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

    # I could make the smile not just a section of a circle but a section where the angle or number of sides (same thing) gets smaller/bigger for more of a curve at the end
